AJAX-Gif-Finder
=======================================
A simple site I made that populates the page with relevant gifs based on keyword searches from user input.   
![demo image](link here)

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with HTML and CSS, and the game logic with Javascript. 
  
+ I used the jQuery library to dynamically update elements on my page and generate buttons based on user input. 
  
+ Based on keyword searches from user input, I make AJAX calls to the GIPHY API to generate relevant gifs.
  
+ Build using the Bootstrap CDN for general page layout and added responsiveness, as well as the animate.css CDN for a few css animations.

## How to Use the Site

1. In the empty search bar, type in a keyword relating to whichever type of gif you're trying to see! This will then appear as a button that can be clicked to generate 10 more relevant gifs.
   
2. The page will filter out certain results based on rating, and then populate the page with gifs based on your search.
   
3. Click on a gif to "play" it, and click again to pause it. You also have the option of downloading the gif if you want.
